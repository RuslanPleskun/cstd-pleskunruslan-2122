            <h2>Season one</h2>
            <p class="description">The first season of the American animated television series, <i><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty" title="Rick and Morty">Rick and Morty</a></i> originally aired in the <a

                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Network" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a>'s late night programming
                block, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Swim" title="Adult Swim">Adult Swim</a>. It premiered on December 2, 2013
                with "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(Rick_and_Morty)" title="Pilot (Rick and Morty)">Pilot</a>" and ended on
                April 14, 2014 with "Ricksy Business", with a total of eleven episodes. The first season received
                critical acclaim.
            </p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Rick convinces his daughter, Beth, and his son-in-law, Jerry, to allow their son, Morty, to continue
                following him in his interdimensional adventures, promising that this will improve his school
                performance. Morty, his parents and his sister, Summer, are dragged into dangerous adventures throughout
                the multiverse, which they manage to escape mostly thanks to Rick's ingenuity.<br><br>

                When Rick and Morty accidentally turn the population of Earth into monsters, they move to an alternate
                dimension where the disaster was averted, leaving Beth, Jerry and Summer behind. They adapt to a
                seemingly identical reality, as they take the place of alternate versions of themselves who died moments
                before their arrival. It is revealed that Rick keeps using Morty as his companion, because his inferior
                brain waves neutralize Rick's genius brain waves, making him undetectable. When Beth and Jerry go on
                vacation, Rick and the kids have a party with numerous guests that turn the house into a mess. Rick
                freezes time so that he and the kids can repair the house, before their parents return.</p>

                     data-description="Death Crystals provide visions of possible death scenarios for those who possess them. Attaining these visions can be achieved by mere touch. As demonstrated by Rick, the Crystals often act as highly effective combat aid by providing an insight on how certain a cause of death will be (highly certain if the visions all share a common trait). This results in a lot of Crystal Poachers to illegally mine the crystals to sell for big money on the market. However, the drawback of the crystals is that it is unable to reveal of the circumstances leading to the death of users in each scenario. This shows when Morty attempted to use the crystal to find the right path to die peacefully at old age with Jessica, apparently have married with him, by his side, resulting him to commit blooded massacres and largely immoral acts. It is later revealed in the end that his visions with Jessica is just her, working in hospice, comforting him in his deathbed (while possibly not recognizing him since she would address other patients the same way), as Morty dies alone."

Hologram Rick was unable to convince Morty, who would rather follow a Death Crystal. Rick self replicated and started protesting Morty's unwillingness to revive Rick, but stopped when Morty threatened to flush away Rick's DNA. He questioned Morty on what death he was intent on pursuing, but quickly understood it to involve Jessica. He later returned while eating a bucket of hologram chicken and was offended when Morty asked why he pretended to eat chicken, sparking an argument on nutrition and food. When Rick and Wasp Rick entered Rick's garage and found several weapons missing, Rick summoned Hologram Rick and accused him of growing sentience and trying to take over. Hologram Rick immediately called the accusation AI racism, before leading to the two wasps to Morty in the desert. They cut off Morty's connection to the ferrofluid, but it then latched onto Hologram Rick and turned him into a huge physical being. Happy to finally have mass, Rick proclaimed himself a god and attacked the two other Ricks. Wasp Rick managed to get in a sting on his left eye and laid eggs inside. The eggs immediately hatched into larvae that ate the insides of Rick's head and cracked open his face to fly out as wasps."

After they serve their purpose, they expire and vanish into the air. Their motivation to help others comes from the fact that existence is painful to a Meeseeks, and the only way to be removed from existence is to complete the task they were called to perform. Physical violence or damage cannot eliminate them, with multiple Meeseeks in the episode sustaining severe head trauma (to the point of having entire sections of their heads caved in and their eyes popping out of their sockets) or bodily mutilation (limbs ripped off, bones broken, multiple lacerations, strangulation, severe blunt force trauma) while still being fully conscious and physically functioning. The first Meeseeks spawned attributed this invulnerability to their being unable to die until their purpose is fulfilled, whether this means it is completely, physically impossible to kill a Meeseeks or whether they simply didn't have the means on Earth to cause enough damage to their bodies that there wouldn't be anything left to function is unclear."

Once it completes the objective, Mr. Meeseeks vanishes. At the end of 'Meeseeks and Destroy' Rick mentioned that he had a 'Fleeseeks Box,' which was met with staunch rejection from the other characters after witnessing the negative repercussions of the Meeseeks Box. Rick then jokingly reveals that it is just a mop and some floor wax."

Being a teddy bear also makes him way shorter than regular Ricks. He wears a robe and slippers, and drinks martinis in his spare time; making him really similar to Fascist Rick. Teddy Rick lives in a universe populated by teddy bear-like creatures, where a fascist regime called "BR" is controlling America, of which he appears to be a veteran. Like many other versions of Rick, he launched his own 'Operation Phoenix' in case of his untimely death. Rick (C-137)'s backup accidentally got uploaded to Teddy Rick's clone and was greeted by his teddy counterpart, who immediately asked him in German if he was fascist. Rick (C-137) immediately took his own life to be uploaded to another universe where fascism was not the norm.

She has blue-green skin with a cat-like face, an elongated head with two rows of small green spikes, large round ears, dark blue eyes with light blue sclera, two dark blue stripes on her right arm, three breasts, and a thumb and two fingers on each hand. She wears a brown sleeveless tunic with a blue gem on the midriff, a white stripe of face paint across her face and nose, a dark green necklace with a deformed dark green pad over her left shoulder, a long brown loincloth, brown strap on her left arm, dark green gauntlets, two brown straps and knee pads on each leg and dark green boots. Jerry also implies she has two sets of genitalia. Despite her tendency to hunt other aliens for sport, Kiara claims she will never harm humans, having formed a Soul Bond with Jerry. However, she takes the custom very seriously, and (hypocritically) hunted Morty and Summer after Jerry wrongfully convinced her they were a threat. She is proven to be a self-righteous hypocrite as right when she began to rant about and call out Jerry and his species for being selfish and manipulative, and for using her as a rebound, she herself was caught by her ex, Trandoor, who pointed out that Earth was his territory. Their argument clearly showed that Kiara was using Jerry for the same exact reason, in order to make her ex-boyfriend jealous."

                     data-description="Glootie seems to be a shiny, slimy, pink alien creature with four blue eyes, a purple mustache, and glossy pink lips. He is short in stature and has white claws on his fingers. Glootie wears an aqua blue jumpsuit with the logo of his app company on it. He has 'DO NOT DEVELOP MY APP' tattooed on his forehead. Glootie is usually a friendly and helpful alien. He doesn't seem to have any issues with existing as an intern or helping Rick with his menial tasks. A notable aspect of his personality is his insistence to create an app; if Glootie interacts with someone, it appears he will most likely ask them to develop an app with him. After Jerry partners up with Glootie to develop Lovefinderrz, a more cunning side to Glootie is revealed. Glootie is actually part of a scheme conjured up by the Monogatron's to take Earth's water, using Lovefinderrz as a distraction. When Morty attempts to force Glootie to shut the app down, Glootie feigns having a bomb in his pocket with a sinister beeping app, causing both Jerry and Morty to flee. However, once he is immediately caught, Glootie is shown to be extremely submissive and willingly takes Jerry and Morty to the Monogatron's mothership, despite them not having any weapons. Once on board, Glootie demonstrates quite a bit of selflessness by setting Jerry and Morty free from a prison and shutting down Lovefinderrz permanently. It is unknown if this makes Glootie an exception within his species or the intervention of Jerry and Morty changed him. Whilst he was shown to be selfless in this act, Glootie casually told the pair he wasn't going to help them anymore than removing their shackles and promptly left them to escape on their own. This is possibly due to him not being a master tactician and knowing he wouldn't really be much use beyond that point anyway."
